                                localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in
                                sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
                                particular tab in the browser,
                                a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.

                                Event Loop : The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript's asynchronous
                                programming. JS executes all operations on a single thread, but using a
                                few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of multi-threading.

                                Easy Definition :
                                The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the
                                Callback Queue or Message Queue.

                                If the Call Stack is empty, it will take the first event from the
                                Callback queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.

                                Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
                                Each event is just a function callback.

                                Easiest explanation :
                                When any Asynchronous event occur such as setTimeOut or promises...
                                Then these task takes some time to complete I/O if they have any.
                                If they completed their I/O or don't have any, then they simply put into
                                message queue or callback queue. Then event loop will firstly execute the
                                call stack tasks and then look for callback or message queue and then execute it..

                                    undefined in JavaScript.</span></strong><br>
                        </h2>

                                undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope.
                                The initial value of undefined
                                is the primitive value undefined.

                                In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property.
                                (Even when this is not the case,
                                avoid overriding it.)

                                A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or
                                statement also returns undefined if the
                                variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns
                                undefined if a value was not
                                returned.

                                Note: While you can use undefined as an identifier (variable name) in any scope other
                                than the global scope (because
                                undefined is not a reserved word), doing so is a very bad idea that will make your code
                                difficult to maintain and debug.

                                // DON'T DO THIS

                                // logs "foo string"
                                (() => {
                                const undefined = 'foo';
                                console.log(undefined, typeof undefined);
                                })();

                                // logs "foo string"
                                ((undefined) => {
                                console.log(undefined, typeof undefined);
                                })('foo');
                                Examples
                                Strict equality and undefined
                                You can use undefined and the strict equality and inequality operators to determine
                                whether a variable has a value. In
                                the following code, the variable x is not initialized, and the if statement evaluates to
                                true.
